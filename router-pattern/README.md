# The Router Pattern

Use-case: **Asynchronous** decision making

Benefits:

- Extremely cost efficient and simple to implement
- Decoupling

Considerations:

- Limited error handling because of the asynchrounous behavior and parallelism
- For complex decision making with error handling and parallelism, use **Amazon state machines**
